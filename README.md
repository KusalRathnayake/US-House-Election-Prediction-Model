# Machine Leaning Models for the Prediction of Us House Election Outcome Using District Level Social and Economic Predictors
In this study, 10 district level demographic and socio-economic variables were used to build a prediction model of US house election outcome.

Predictor Variables:

1. White %
2. Black %
3. Asian %
4. Hispanic %
5. Female %
6. Age 18 to 55 %
7. Age 55 plus %
8. International immigration count
9. Farming personnel %
10. Personal income

Dependent Variable: Democratic win (1: win or 0: lose)

Logistic regression and point biserial correlation were used to identify the significance of the predictor variables. Support vector machines (SVM), Decision trees, Random Forests (RF) and ANN methods were used to build the prediction model and the model classification accuracies were compared.
